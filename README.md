Hello I'm Tais
I have a bachelor's degree in information systems and a post-dregree in mobile development.
I've been working as a QA Engineer for Samsung since 2020.
I'm very passionate about technology, especially mobile development and testing using Java, Appium and others.
This profile is in progress, I'll be inputting my personal projects here soon.
